# moviepicker

If you cannot decide which movie to go for, let ðŸŽ¬moviepicker decide!

## How it all started

Me and my pals were having trouble picking out the right movie, it was all crap, but we gotta pick one. So one of my bros was like 'why not `random()`?' and others were like 'yeah, go with `random() % 2`!'. Then it hit me, so I said: good idea, hold on...

Of course on such short notice I did not get to finish this complete function, at the moment I just use one line of code: `for(i in 1:5) cat(sample(0:1)[1])`. But then after things settled down, I completed this program. This is just a toy, but still, lots of good memory...
